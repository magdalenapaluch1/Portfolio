# PORTFOLIO - Software Testing

## ABOUT ME
I have 4,5 years of experience in design. I have got experience with creating technical documentation. Last three years I worked in designed teams in rail industry and earlier worked in FTTH projects for corporate client. I am oriented for technical sector, especially oil and gas industry. I like learning new things e.g. now I'm learning new language: Danish or when I have enough time I'm trying to crocheting. My guilty pleasure is playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive with friends.
